# OK, Gradle!
IntelliJ/Android Studio Plugin for searching artifacts ids of popular Java libraries.

Use those for adding new dependencies easily to your build.gradle files.

#### Retrofit - which one was it?
```
compile 'com.square.retrofit:retrofit2:2.3.0'
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.3.0'
```

#### Android Design library - which one was it?
```
compile 'com.android.support:design:26.1.0'
compile 'com.android.support:support-design:26.1.0'
```

With this plugin, you won't have to remember it anymore nor open an external browser to search for it on the Internet.

Usage:

Find the **OK, Gradle** action  with `CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+A` shortcut and type library's name that you are looking for in an input field.

To make your life even more easier, assign a shortcut to it. Personally, I prefer `CMD+K` - as in **"OK!"** (I don't use commit action in the IDE anyway).

You need to have an active Internet connection to be able to use this tool.
